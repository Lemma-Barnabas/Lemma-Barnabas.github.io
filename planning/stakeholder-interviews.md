## 1. First Interview

<!--
  Take some time getting to know your partner and their ambitions. Ask questions about:

  - Their background (Professional, programming, personal)
  - Their ambitions (Professional, programming, personal)
  - Outside interests (For tying into a personal statement)
  - And much more ... listen to your partner and ask questions about what they tell you.

  The best way to do your interview is with a lot of `why?`.
  Try to always use their answer in your next question, this makes sure you understand what they said.

  Start your interview with one or two open-ended questions and follow up with a lot of `why?`, this gives your partner the chance to really explain themselves instead of just answering your questions. You might find that they even learn something about themselves!
-->

### Notes

<!-- Notes you took during the interview. -->

- Full stack developer student at Hack your Future Belgium
- Originally from Ethiopia
- Excited about career path

- Already built some exciting projects

- Want to showcase skills and personality

### Summary

<!-- Consolidate your notes into a few sentences. Do your best to express what your partner was trying to say, not what you learned from them. -->

Barnabas wishes to build a website that can showcase his skill-sets this far in
his web-development career. He is really excited and ambitious about his career
and this is reflected in the projects that he has built.

His ambition is that with this portfolio website, recruiters and other fellow
developers can clearly see who Barnabas is, what kind of personality he has and
his skill-sets. As a result, it is becomes quite clear what and how Barnabas can
contribute to a team.

For the portfolio website, the goal is to have two pages, a homepage/landing
page and a second page showcasing his personal projects.

## 2. Follow-Up Interview

<!--
  In this follow up interview you will present to your partner a summary of your first interview. You will do your best effort to understand, rephrase, and communicate your partners needs back to them. Take this chance to listen for their feedback on how well you understand their situation. Update your notes accordingly
-->

### Notes

- Dark theme and background

- Contact section is desirable

- Social Media links

### Summary

- The client is interested in having a dark background and some contrasting
  colors. This is based on his appreciation for **the terminal**.

- The client prefers to have a separate contact section aside from the nav bar.
  This necessitates the addition of an extra page for the website

## 3. Capture Findings

<!-- Take some time to consolidate & summarize what you learned in the previous two interviews. -->

### Needs

<!-- What exactly does your partner need from their home page? Are they looking for collaborators? A job?Learning opportunities? Or something you never expected? -->

- Barnabas has hopes of finding a job as a Software Developer. To this end he
  would like to document his journey through a custom made website that can
  attract recruiters.

- This website should provide a summary of who Barnabas is, his skills and what
  he would bring to a company when offered a job. As such, this website is an
  important statement for Barnabas.

### Insights

<!-- New learnings about your partner to use in your design -->

- Based on his appreciation of the terminal, it would be great to have a design
  that mimics or rather is inspired by the terminal.

## 4. Define the Problem

<!--
  In your own words describe:

  - Why does your partner need this home page?
  - How do they want to be represented?
  - Who do they want to visit their page?
  - What do they want different visitors to see them?

  A useful format:

  - _partner's name_ needs a way to _?_.
    - Unexpectedly, in their world, _?_.
-->

- Barnabas needs a way to showcase his skills and personality to recruiters

- As a creative person, Barnabas needs something really visual to capture the
  different aspects of his imagination and creativity

- Unfortunately, resumes are mostly limited to word documents or one page
  templates that do not provide enough room to showcase oneself

- A personal website is just the perfect tool to showcase skills and creativity
  without much limits

- This website is a personal statement for Barnabas to recruiters, fellow
  developers and common folks who might be interested to know more about his
  craft

## 5. Open-Ended Ideation

<!--
  Sketch up a few wireframe for your partner's home page with no regard for your their programming ability, time constraints, technical constraints, or any other practical considerations.
  How are the designs different? How does each one serve your partner differently?
-->

- This represents the first draft design of the website based on the interview
  with Barnabas

- The website features three pages

## 6. Partner Feedback

<!-- Discuss your ideas with your partner. lots of `why?`. -->

### Summary

- Barnabas was vey much excited and appreciative of the first draft. Several
  comments were given to further improve the site

- As earlier stated, Barnabas would like a dark themed website with inspiration
  from the **terminal**

- Barnabas would like the website to feature the **monospace** font

- Three pages for the website are better than two as earlier proposed

- It would be nice to have some bright contrasting color to call out important
  info

## 8. Design

<!-- Propose an Atomic Design for your partner's home page. This could include a color palate, button designs, icons, ... -->

- The final draft design was prepared after updating the first draft with
  stakeholder and user feedback

## 9. Final Feedback

<!--
  The Design Process is never finished!

  After you've finished the Plan & Design ask your partner for feedback. In a professional setting this would be the beginning of a whole new development cycle.
