# User Personas

**The project objective** : In most cases people apply for jobs by sending
curriculum vitae (CV) written in a word file or other document editors. This
also applies to creating an online presence on job sites such as **LinkedIn**.
However, in some fields such as **Software Engineering** recruited may want to
something more that just a word file. For this reason most developers create
their personal portfolio that can tell their story on their behalf. This also
offers a better opportunity to showcase creativity.
